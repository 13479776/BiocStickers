# Sticker development guidelines

To start with a new sticker you might want to use the template
[template.xcf](template/template.xcf) (gimp format) or you might want
look at the 
[`hexSticker`](https://github.com/GuangchuangYu/hexSticker) package to
produce the sticker entirely in `R`.

You can also find a tutorial [Sticker_instructions.png] (Tutorial/Sticker_instructions.png) to design your stickers manually in `Illustrator`.


+ Each sticker should be put into a folder named according to the package.
+ Each folder should also contain a *README.md* providing at least the name of
  the package and the designer/maintainer of the sticker (which is not
  necessarily the maintainer of the package).
+ The height of the final png should be 5cm, resolution should be at least
  300dpi.
+ While it is not mandatory, it is suggested to use the *Aller* font for the
  text (available in folder *fonts/Aller*.
+ Ideally, the position of the package name text (bottom line) should be 18mm
  from the top of the image.
+ Some suggestions for color definitions:
